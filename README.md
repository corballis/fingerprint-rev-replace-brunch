## Usage
Install the plugin via npm with `npm install --save-dev fingerprint-rev-replace-brunch`.

This plugin is intended to be used with [fingerprint-brunch](https://github.com/dlepaux/fingerprint-brunch). Please make
sure it is also installed.

This plugin will use the assets file generated by fingerprint-brunch to replace URLs in the contents of files.

## Configuration

Configure the plugin in the following section of your brunch-config file:

```
plugins: {
    fingerprintRevReplace: {
            
    }
}
```

#### options.canonicalUris
Type: `boolean`

Default: `true`

Use canonical Uris when replacing filePaths. I.e. when working with file paths
with non forward slash (`/`) path separators, we replace them with forward slash.

#### options.replaceInExtensions
Type: `Array`

Default: `['.js', '.css', '.html']`

Only substitute in new file names in files of these types.

#### options.prefix
Type: `string`

Default: ``

Add the prefix string to each replacement.

#### options.modifyUnreved, options.modifyReved
Type: `Function`

Modify the name of the unreved/reved files before using them. The file name is
passed to the function as the first argument.

For example, if in your manifest you have:

```js
{"js/app.js.map": "js/app-98adc164.js.map"}
```

If you wanted to get rid of the `js/` path just for `.map` files (because they
are sourcemaps and the references to them are relative, not absolute), you could
do the following:

```js
function replaceJsIfMap(filename) {
    if (filename.indexOf('.map') > -1) {
        return filename.replace('js/', '');
    }
    return filename;
}
```

And then in your brunch configuration:
```js
plugins: {
    fingerprintRevReplace: {
        modifyUnreved: replaceJsIfMap,
        modifyReved: replaceJsIfMap    
    }
}
```
